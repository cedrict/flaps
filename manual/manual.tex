\section{Introduction}

This code first started as a stone in the fieldstone project \cite{fieldstone}.
As it was growing and it appeared that it would be used for different projects
I decided to take it out and turn it into a standalone code with its own manual.

The code only supports one type of Finite Elements, the $Q_2\times Q_1$ pair, 
which is stable and commonly used in geodynamics \cite{thba22}.

\section{Benchmarking}



The goal here is to explore the influence of the mapping polynomial order and/or
the number of quadrature points on the accuracy of the solution of various benchmarks and test cases.

Concretely, in this section we will explore the effect of:
\begin{itemize}
\item resolution via the number of elements in the radial direction: {\python nelr=2-32} (we automatically set {\python nelt=12*nelr})
\item the number of quadrature points per dimension: {\python nqperdim=2,3,4,5}
\item the polynomial order of the mapping: {\python mapping='Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4'}
\end{itemize}
and we will monitor the computed area/volume, the root mean square velocity and the velocity and pressure errors.

\subsection{Notes to self}

What I have tried to cure the pb of the weird anomalies at the poles.

\begin{itemize}
\item turning elements into real trapezes. Made things worse
\item different mappings. not much difference
\item when using blob, reduced densities. no difference
\item nb of quad points, no real difference
\item nb of elements in tangential direction, some difference but no cure 
\item when using blob, drho/rho, no diff 
\item type of b.c. at point corner below poles, no real diff 
\item scaling of G matrix
\item different rotations/bc for free slip, no difference
\item using cmat matrix for dev strain rate, helped a little bit, no cure 
\end{itemize}



%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{To do list}
\begin{itemize}
\item visc profiles
\item rho profiles
\item time stepping
\item gravity calculations. import from f96, re-benchmark
\item CBF? 
\item compute self gravity for reduced density case 
\item export exx1 and exx3 to outside function, clean their code too? 
\item remove call to math 
\item bottom free slip 
\item change y for z in stone
\item use PREM gravity value
\item aspect with GMG ?
\item compute moment of inertia
\item by default code now uses elemental rho and eta. it changes things wrt exp0 benchmark results!
\item change all eyy and exy to ezz exz
\item difference between surfaceV and outerQ2 ?!?
\item remove hrhs and frhs make it rhs
\end{itemize}
